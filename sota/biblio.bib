While disaggregation of hard-drives storage is a common practice, {NVMe}-{SSD} (i.e., {PCIe}-based {SSD}) disaggregation is considered more challenging. This is because {SSDs} are signiﬁcantly faster than hard drives, so the latency overheads (due to both network and {CPU} processing) as well as the extra compute cycles needed for the oﬄoading stack become much more pronounced.},

	abstract = {The end of Moore’s Law and Dennard Scaling has slowed processor improvements in the past decade. While multi-core processors have improved performance, they are limited by the application’s level of parallelism, as prescribed by Amdahl’s Law. This has led to the emergence of domain-specific processors that specialize in a narrow range of functions. Smart Network Interface Cards ({SmartNICs}) can be seen as a revolutionary technology that combines heterogeneous domain-specific processors and general-purpose cores to offload infrastructure tasks. Despite the impressive advantages of {SmartNICs} and their importance in modern networks, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey. To this end, this paper provides a background encompassing an overview of the evolution of {NICs} from basic to {SmartNICs}, describing their architectures, development environments, and advantages over legacy {NICs}. The paper then presents a comprehensive taxonomy of applications offloaded to {SmartNICs}, covering network, security, storage, and compute functions. Challenges associated with {SmartNIC} development and deployment are discussed, along with current initiatives and open research issues.},

	abstract = {Disaggregated data centers ({DCs}) can offer high flexibility for resource allocation; hence, their resource utilization can be significantly improved. However, communications between different types of resources, in particular between {CPU} and memory, in fully disaggregated {DCs} face severe problems in terms of stringent requirements for ultra-low latency and ultra-high transmission bandwidth. Optical fiber communication is promising to provide high capacity and low latency, but it is still challenging for the state-of-the-art optical technologies to meet the requirements of fully disaggregated {DCs}. In this article, different levels of resource disaggregation are investigated. For fully disaggregated {DCs}, two architectural options are presented, where optical interconnects are necessary for the {CPU}-memory communications. We review the state-of-the-art optical transmission and switching technologies, and analyze pros and cons of their applicability in the disaggregated {DCs}. The results reveal that resource disaggregation does improve the resource utilization in {DCs}. However, the bandwidth provided by the state-of-the-art technologies is not always sufficient for fully disaggregated {DCs}. It calls for further advances in optical communications to fully utilize the advantages of fully disaggregated {DCs}.},
